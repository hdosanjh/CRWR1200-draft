DEATH: grandmother's death - however this happened recently and it might be difficult to write about it. Not sure how I'd write about it. I just want to write something to make myself be okay with the loss.

~~LOVE: is it possible to be in love with two people at the same time? More so, how do you know you're with the right one when they both feel right? Even more troublesome is when you're with one lover but your heart aches for the other one? and vice-versa? (TOO MANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS. Not sure if I want to tackle this one, it will end up making me feel too uncomfortable. Pros: if I write about it maybe my head will get cleared)~~


~~Suggestion from dad: to write about his love of peacocks. Maybe use this as the basis into something deeper: take the time to notice the unqiue things around us? to love the several different creations in this world?~~
