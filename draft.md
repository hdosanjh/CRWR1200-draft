DEATH: grandma's death - however this happened recently and it might be difficult to write about it. Not sure how I'd write about it. I just want to write something to make myself be okay with the loss. 
- visited my dreams several times right after she passed, maybe it's because I didn't see her enough in real life when she got sick (because my dumb self thought she'd somehow beat cancer because she's survived so much before that), I didn't saw her almost 4 months before she passed (decemeber), had the oppurtunity to see her literally a week or so before she passed(april) but I was too afraid to see her.. plus I had already given my shitty goodbye back in december and had accepted the fact that I would never see her again. But the **dreams** they mean something.
-I gave up on her by not going to victoria to throw her ashes away so... the last time I would have been able to see her I guess or last time I would feel her? And I didn't go due to a class... but was my class that important? GUILT!!!! Another reason she visited my dreams!!! I could have been there to heal myself. In a way throwing someone's ashes, seeing them flow gently into the water WOULD have provided me closure/comfort. That's the problem, my closure partially came from what I experienced at the ferry but the other part would've been throwing her ashes away.
- realization on ferry: "You're always going to be here for me even if I wasn't there for you like I should've been."

~~LOVE: is it possible to be in love with two people at the same time? More so, how do you know you're with the right one when they both feel right? Even more troublesome is when you're with one lover but your heart aches for the other one? and vice-versa? (TOO MANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS. Not sure if I want to tackle this one, it will end up making me feel too uncomfortable. Pros: if I write about it maybe my head will get cleared)~~


~~Suggestion from dad: to write about his love of peacocks. Maybe use this as the basis into something deeper: take the time to notice the unqiue things around us? to love the several different creations in this world?~~

**bolded means I need to clarify or make it better**

A care home can be considered an aslyum for the physically ill. It can also be considered a place of refuge since it offers shelter, intensive care and security. However it does not provide love and compassion. The nurses don't love their patients but maybe they feel some sympathy. After all, the patients are patiently waiting for death while the nurses aquire the neccessary skills in aiding for the progression. 

The nurses didn't wail and slap themselves on the head when they went to go check up on my grandma one morning only to notice she was **pulseless**. However, my Nani who was visiting India at the time was the one wailing over the phone and most likely dramatically hitting herself on the head. How **funny** is it that someone miles away is mourning but the people who took care of my grandma simply prepare to clean her room for the next patient who will take residence. 

We may be born alone, and maybe our births were celebrated or uncelebrated but dying alone is the inevitable. What was her last thought before she fell asleep that night? As her soul left her body was she happy that she would finally reunite with her husband after **44 years? ASK DAD** Who did she go to sleep thinking of? Did she wonder about me that night or the week following her death? Because I wasn't wondering about her.

~~Her funeral was held in _ Victoria. Victoria is my favourite place on this earth. Even if I visited the monstrous Grand Canyon, The Great Wall of China, or the desirable beauty of the Taj Mahal and among many other enticing places, I know in my heart that none of them will make me feel the way Victoria does. It makes me feel happy in all the ways one would hope to be. It has become more close to my heart since my grandma's ashes were **thrown** in the waters of _ (a beach by beacon park? will have to clarify exact name. ask Dad or Harvinder)~~ is this part even important

Her funeral was held in _ Victoria. While taking the ** seven 'o' clock evening** ferry back to Tsawwassen I sat outside for one hour staring at the water. I was shivering in my black dress and my parka was failing at keeping me warm. The sun had started to set. I saw the clouds and the blue sky swirl into a golden, citrine light and then slowly the sun transformed the sky into a wash of apricot and began to pinken. I remember feeling her presence in the water. Her soul was swimming in there. I got up from where I was sitting and stood beside the railing. I thought I heard her speak to me so I took my earphones out to listen. All I heard was the churning of the water and the chatter of people. I was in a completely different state that I have no idea how to explain. It felt like I was floating. Being on the ferry was a dream and the funeral never happened. Sometimes people say they can feel the presence of a spirit. Maybe what I felt from staring at the water symbolizes that she will always be wherever I go. She will travel in the water to look over me. [In London, **(the river... forgot it's name. ASK SAAD)** I felt her there with me. It was for a split second, a moment gone too soon that I couldn't keep the way I kept it on the ferry.]  change the was's. too many
