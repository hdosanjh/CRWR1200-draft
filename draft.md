Topic: South Asian community in the lower mainland ignoring the drug issue in Punjab (usage of drugs, trade of drugs etc.)

My concern is that the Punjabi families are ignoring the drug/addiction situation back home even though they DO know it's a serious problem that they choose to not talk about it. 

Why do they send hundreds of dollars back home? Especially if they have family members who have an addiction to drugs? Example: My grandmother for years sent thousands of dollars to her nephew and SHE knew he had an alochol addiction, cocaine and herione as well. SHE knew he was consuming other drugs besides alchohol. So then why was she so surprised when he passed away from liver disease? And that he had been in that sickly addictive state before he passed?

Almost every Punjabi person in Surrey/Vancouver knows how horrible the issue is back home. They're perfectly aware of the fact that the police are arresting random druggies, are connected to the head of the drug distribution, allow drugs to get passed through because the drug boss PAYS them money to not get caught. All the while the drugs are continuing to be consumed by the youth and I've heard no one talk about wanting to help. They are also aware how bad the state of the youth is. My mother went to India in 2015, she came back telling me how misbehaved the youth are and that they seemed stoned off of God-knows-what 24/7. SHE knows the drug situation is becoming worse and worse. Why doesn't she worry how it will be 5-10 years from now? That's her home! Where she grew up in for most of her teenage years. What if there's a time where it will be too unsafe to enter Punjab because it's turned into a massive drug cartel? My mom usually says she's not worried because her village is a goody-two-shoes. I'm challenging that fact to change if this drug issue keeps growing. 

Should I approach the story as nonfiction or fiction?

I want to do fiction because I want to create something where there's a relative from Vancouver sending money over to a niece/nephew in Punjab. The money is for the young person's living or something. Most people in Punjab spend their times in the farms, usually either  hired by a farmer or as a farmer who owns the farm and their kids help with the crops. Of course since villages in Punjab are small and everyone knows everyone's business, it's a little difficult to let's say carry 3 kilos of cocaine around. The best way to do it would be at night, or at dawn by the crops; the person selling it to a drug dealer would have to throw it in the crops and then the person recieving it to either transport it or for themseleves would find it in the field, for this story this happens regularly. The niece/nephew would most likely work for a farmer and sleep in a hut by the farm. What would happen if that certain niece/nephew just happened to be wandering around at night and a mysterious package flies out of nowhere beside them? Next they hear the two people who are finding it, confused as to where the packet is and then exclaiming that the package is worth 30,000 rupees? (made up number.) Would the person open it, smell it, recognize it's drugs and either 1. ignore it or 2. realize they can make heaps of rupees by selling it? 

**Not sure if I'm going to include the relative sending money over. Othwerise then the person would be somewhat finacially stable before finding the packet. I think I'm going to make the niece/nephew find the package first, get into some trouble and then dial someone in Surrey, make up a lie for money issues and from there the relative will start sending money over.**
