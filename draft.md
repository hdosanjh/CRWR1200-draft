Topic: South Asian community in the lower mainland ignoring the drug issue in Punjab (usage of drugs, trade of drugs etc.)

My concern is that the Punjabi families are ignoring the drug/addiction situation back home even though they DO know it's a serious problem that they choose to not talk about it. 

Why do they send hundreds of dollars back home? Especially if they have family members who have an addiction to drugs? Example: My grandmother for years sent thousands of dollars to her nephew and SHE knew he had an alochol addiction, cocaine and herione as well. SHE knew he was consuming other drugs besides alchohol. So then why was she so surprised when he passed away from liver disease? And that he had been in that sickly addictive state before he passed?

Almost every Punjabi person in Surrey/Vancouver knows how horrible the issue is back home. They're perfectly aware of the fact that the police are arresting random druggies, are connected to the head of the drug distribution, allow drugs to get passed through because the drug boss PAYS them money to not get caught. All the while the drugs are continuing to be consumed by the youth and I've heard no one talk about wanting to help. They are also aware how bad the state of the youth is. My mother went to India in 2015, she came back telling me how misbehaved the youth are and that they seemed stoned off of God-knows-what 24/7. SHE knows the drug situation is becoming worse and worse. Why doesn't she worry how it will be 5-10 years from now? That's her home! Where she grew up in for most of her teenage years. What if there's a time where it will be too unsafe to enter Punjab because it's turned into a massive drug cartel? My mom usually says she's not worried because her village is a goody-two-shoes. I'm challenging that fact to change if this drug issue keeps growing. 


I want to do fiction because I want to create something where there's a relative from Vancouver sending money over to a niece/nephew in Punjab. The money is for the young person's living or something. Most people in Punjab spend their times in the farms, usually either  hired by a farmer or as a farmer who owns the farm and their kids help with the crops. Of course since villages in Punjab are small and everyone knows everyone's business, it's a little difficult to let's say carry 3 kilos of cocaine around. The best way to do it would be at night, or at dawn by the crops; the person selling it to a drug dealer would have to throw it in the crops and then the person recieving it to either transport it or for themseleves would find it in the field, for this story this happens regularly. The niece/nephew would most likely work for a farmer and sleep in a hut by the farm. What would happen if that certain niece/nephew just happened to be wandering around at night and a mysterious package flies out of nowhere beside them? Next they hear the two people who are finding it, confused as to where the packet is and then exclaiming that the package is worth 30,000 rupees? (made up number.) Would the person open it, smell it, recognize it's drugs and either 1. ignore it or 2. realize they can make heaps of rupees by selling it? 

**Not sure if I'm going to include the relative sending money over. Othwerise then the person would be somewhat finacially stable before finding the packet. I think I'm going to make the niece/nephew find the package first, get into some trouble and then dial someone in Surrey, make up a lie for money issues and from there the relative will start sending money over.**

The mango sun kisses the milky green well as the young girl collects the fallen feathers of the peacocks. When she reaches home she places the feathers next to the ones collected yesterday morning. She sighs as she quickly places her long hair into a bun. In the small courtyard she splashes some cold water from the steel bucket onto her face. Her brother walks out of his room adjusting the pleats in his turban. His hand grazes over the little gold plated star on his uniform. Sometimes Amreen wonders if she too could be a police officer. The idea of sharing that thought foreshadows an image of her brother slapping her across the face hard enough to leave a pink hand-print. They couldn't keep surviving off his useless earnings. Besides working in the fields barely made a thousand rupees a month. If anything she felt like a slave. ~~An education is a far reach but what could be the harm in being a police officer like him? ~~
"I'm heading out," Pritam calls out as he opens the gate.
"No roti today?!" Amreen shouts pacing towards him. 
"Karmendra is treating me today!" He yelled over the engine of his scooter. The deputy officer treated Pritam like a son and even got him the APSI position. Amreen doesn't know much about her parents. She knows her mother passed giving birth to her but nothing about her father's whereabouts. Karmendra's wife and other women around the village helped to nurture Amreen in the early years. As soon as she could tend to herself she'd been placed along her brother to do farm work. Karmendra had taken a liking to the boy. Of course never having beared a son of his own it was easy to warm up to Pritam. Karmendra couldn't take in Pritam as an officer until the age of 18 but when he turned 20, Karmendra taught him basic knowledge for the written exam, trained him for the physical exam and of course he was going to be the interviewer so Pritam had it easy from the start. Amreen waved a goodbye that her brother failed to notice. She sighed thinking, *what could have been the harm in training me as a police officer as well?* 
On her walk to the farm, Amreen pretends to pinch the crows sitting on the tree. Most days she stayed to sleep at the huts by the farms. It wasn't worth it to walk back and forth from the farm to her home every day.
